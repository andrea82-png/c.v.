DISCLAIMER:

no scientific reference is to be assumed for any usage of this sheet. 
this is purely a personal and non-professional attempt of analyzing this event.

DESCRIPTION:

a. data collection

the analysis of the event is taken into consideration via a (present day):(previous day) ratio calculation.
no single and different sub-events rather than the two polarized macro-categories (which sums up any possible incomes/outcomes) or additional information about the containment of the disease are concerned.         
Each arrow symbolizes a (healthly) positive or negative advancing of the spread in comparison to the overall data

b. forecasting

this rawly and roughly utilizes the median ratio of the last 7 days to project a forecasting to the hopefully expected date where the two sums will cancel each other out.
